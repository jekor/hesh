Hesh makes writing scripts in Haskell easier. Here's an example:

``` {.haskell .numberLines}
#!/usr/bin/env hesh
-- Backup a PostgreSQL database to an encrypted file.

main = do
  args <- System.Environment.getArgs
  case args of
    [database] -> do
      today <- $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
      let file = database ++ "-" ++ today ++ ".sql.gpg"
      $(pg_dump $database) |> $(gpg -e -r $EMAIL) /> file
    _ -> do
      progName <- System.Environment.getProgName
      $(echo "Usage: $progName <database>") /> "/dev/stderr"
```

Let's look at how this differs from standard Haskell.

* On line 1, hesh is used like runhaskell to start the script without previous compilation.
* On line 5, the call to `System.Environment.getArgs` has no accompanying qualified import.
* On line 8, `$()` is used to execute a command and read its output into a variable (like Bash's `$()`).
* On line 10, `$()` is used again, this time with a variable substitution (`$database`). However, instead of reading the result of the command into a variable, standard output is piped (`|>`) to another command. The output of that command is redirected (`/>`) to a file.

# Hesh as a Shell

Hesh is not an interactive shell.[^interactive] It's intended only for scripts. It's designed to reduce the verbosity of Haskell for shell-script-style tasks enough to make it a viable alternative to Bash.[^compatibility]

Hesh implements some of the functionality you'd expect from a shell, such as process spawning, I/O redirection, and variable substitution. For the rest, you can rely on Haskell and its libraries.

## Spawning Processes

Spawning a process with `$()` behaves somewhat similar to what you'd expect from other shells, but is designed to be minimal.[^nesting] It interprets its contents in 3 steps:

1. separate into tokens on whitespace (excluding [quoted](#quoting) whitespace)
2. expand variables
3. spawn the command specified by the first token with all folowing tokens as arguments

`$()` returns either a `String`{.haskell}, a `CreateProcess`{.haskell}, or `()`{.haskell} (all in a `MonadIO`{.haskell} monad), depending on the context. This---along with some proprocessing Hesh does before compiling your script---helps make sure it behaves as you'd expect in most cases.

### Quoting

If you want a string containing whitespace to be passed as a single argument to a program, you must quote it with double-quotes (`""`). To use a quote inside double quotes, escape it with a backslash (`\"`).

### Variable Expansion

`$()` expands any variable reference of the form `$variableName` or `${variableName}` (the latter allows for placing variables next to each other or within a string of text, like `${var1}${var2}` or `computer${suffix}`). If you want to include a literal `$`, escape it with a backslash (`\$`).

Variables must be valid Haskell identifiers (excluding infix operators),[^haskellvariables] such as `$varName` or `$val'`. For convenience, if the variable begins with an uppercase character, it's assumed to be an environment variable name and substituted with the corresponding environment variable.[^environmentvariables]

Note that variables are expanded *after* tokenization. This means that you don't have to worry about a variable containing whitespace: it will still be passed as a single argument (unlike with Bash). For example, in:

```haskell
let var = "a filename with spaces"
in $(ls $var)
```

the `ls` program will be called with a single argument, not with 4 arguments.

### Argument Lists

If you already have a list of arguments you'd like to pass to a program, you can use `cmd` instead of `$()`. `$()` itself invokes `cmd` after tokenization and variable expansion. The following 2 examples are equivalent:

```haskell
$(ls a b c)
```

```haskell
cmd "ls" ["a", "b", "c"]
```

## Redirecting I/O

`|>`

:   Pipes the output of the process on the left to the input of the process on the right.[^pipestderr] This behaves the same as Bash's `|` (but is named differently to prevent clashing with Haskell's `|`).

`/>`

:   Redirects the output of a process to a file. This behaves the same as Bash's `>` (again named differently to prevent clashing with Haskell's `>`).

`!>`

:   Redirects stderr of a process to a file. This behaves the same as Bash's `2>` (which is not a valid identifier in Haskell).

`&>`

:   Redirects both stdout and stderr of a process to a file. This behaves the same as Bash's `&>`.

`</`

:   Read a file as input to a process. This behaves the same as Bash's `<`.

`<//`

:   Read a String (or Text or strict ByteString) as input to a process. Note that this requires the program to be compiled with `-threaded` (the default if executed by `hesh` itself).

All of these functions are available via the `Hesh` library (which is automatically imported for use in Hesh scripts), so you can also use them in your non-Hesh Haskell programs.[^sugar]

Each output operator (`/>`, `!>`, `&>`) has an append version (`/>>`, `!>>`, `&>>`) that will append to the given output file instead of overwriting it (like bash's `>>`).

# Hesh as a Compiler

You can use Hesh to compile native binaries. In fact, that's what Hesh is doing each time it evaluates your script:

1. pre-process the script
2. generate a Cabal file
3. run Cabal build in a temporary directory[^tmpdir]
4. execute the resulting binary

Normally when you run hesh it will automatically execute the given script (if it compiles successfully). If you use the `-c` option, hesh will only compile the script and output the resulting executable to stdout.

## Preprocessing

Hesh's first feature was its automatic Cabal file generation. Without it, your scripts would be limited to the base libraries. From there, the preprocessor evolved hand-in-hand with Hesh's shell functions in order to make writing scripts feel as natural as possible. The preprocessor does the following:

1. desugars `$()` into `[sh||]` quasiquotes[^nosugar]
2. finds all uses of qualified names and adds them to the import list (e.g. `System.Environment.getArgs`)
3. looks in the Hackage database for any modules imported and adds them to the generated Cabal file
4. adds a type signature to `$()` in certain common contexts

## Hesh and Hackage

The first time you run Hesh, it will take a while. That's because it's parsing the Hackage database (the one created by `cabal update`) and converting it into a more convient form for future runs.[^hackagecache] Hesh uses this database to look up which package a module belongs to.

Hesh uses a very simplistic method of looking up packages and specifying package version constraints. In particular, its behavior is undefined if more than 1 package exports a module with the same name. In order to disambiguate between packages that export the same module, you can use package-qualified imports.[^packageimports] For example, to import the vector package implementation of Data.Vector, use `import "vector" Data.Vector`.

[^interactive]: Hesh is on its way to becoming an interactive shell, but there are non-trivial obstacles to making it one.

[^compatibility]: If it wasn't obvious, Hesh is not Bash-compatible, even though it borrows some of its syntax.

[^sugar]: Note that `$()` is syntactic sugar for Hesh's `sh` quasiquoter, so you have to convert all instances of `$(command)` to `[sh|command|]` if you use the Hesh library outside of Hesh.

[^pipestderr]: As with Bash, piping does not affect stderr.

[^nesting]: `$()` does not currently support nesting.

[^haskellvariables]: Allowed variable names start with any lowercase Unicode character followed by any number of Unicode alphanumeric characters and/or apostrophes (`'`).

[^environmentvariables]: Allowed environment variable names start with any uppercase Unicode character followed by any number of Unicode alphanumeric characters and/or underscores (`_`). If you want to reference an environment variable that doesn't begin with an uppercase character, you'll need to read it into a Haskell variable via `System.Environment.getEnv` first.

[^tmpdir]: A new temporary directory is created every time the script changes. Hesh used to also use a Cabal sandbox to try to mitigate dependency problems, but the result was found to be too expensive while developing and testing scripts.

[^nosugar]: Desugaring activates the TemplateHaskell and QuasiQuotes Haskell extensions. You can skip this desugaring by passing the `--no-sugar` or `-n` option to Hesh.

[^hackagecache]: The modules from the Hackage database is cached in `modules.json` in your Hackage path (usually `packages/hackage.haskell.org` in your `.cabal` directory).

[^packageimports]: See [http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/syntax-extns.html#package-imports](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#package-qualified-imports) for more details.
